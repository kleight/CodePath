## Dropbox

The purpose of this homework is to use Xcode to implement the flow between the screens of an application. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement the Dropbox app from the signed out state to the basic signed in state.

Time spent: `<8.5 hours>`

### Features

#### Required

- [X] User can tap through the 3 welcome screens.
- [X] User can follow the create user flow.
  - [X] On the create user form, the user can tap the back button to go to the page where they can sign in or create an account.
  - [X] Before creating the account, user can choose to read the terms of service.
  - [X] After creating the account, user can view the placeholders for Files, Photos, and Favorites as well as the Settings screen.
  - [X] User can log out from the Settings screen.

#### The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to use Git to end up with 2 versions of the project. One for required features, the other for optional features.
2.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1. Duplicating my Xcode project so that I could do the optional features in a separate project. And realizing it effed up my original files. Found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17744319/duplicate-and-rename-xcode-project-associated-folders

2. Had issues with scroll view due to clicking something that re-set my auto-sizing of the Image View.

* Any libraries or borrowed content.
