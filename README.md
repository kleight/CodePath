# CodePath
Projects from CodePath iOS class of Fall 2016.

Click on Assignments to see various app clones built during the class. 

Each assignment includes a GIF demonstrating the features that were implemented.

Don't bother clicking on Labs. They are fragments of incomplete projects that I used as referrence for the Assignments.
